## Drown Out Distractions

***Development on this has stalled until I can set up a home server or find really cheap hosting. Using the freesound.org API to download the sounds on app load is too slow and there are no good hosting providers that can accomodate this applications without paying way too much money.**

There's this site I really like to use for drowning out noise called [asoftmurmur](https://asoftmurmur.com). I've been using it for years but I noticed a couple of things recently that caused some alarm.

1. **It hasn't been updated in 5 years.** Anyone who develops software knows that a project is either being actively maintained or is dead. It may take a while for the code to rot away completely but it will happen; all while leaving the users more and more vulnerable as time passes. From what I can tell the app is written in React which will have 3rd party dependencies, all of which need to be updated regularly. This leads me to my next point -

2. **It's closed source.** This means I have no idea what's actually happening within the app while I'm using it. I'm sure the creator of the app has nothing but good intentions but experience has taught me to trust open source above anything closed. Open source code is inherently more secure and trustworthy. Plus it has the added benefit of being forkable so if I get hit by a bus or I don't touch it for over 5 years someone else can pick up the torch.
